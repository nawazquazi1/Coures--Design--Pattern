/*
                        COMMAND DESIGN PATTERN
    it's kind of one size fits all situations; same command will execute the appropriate actions depending on the request.
    It encapsulates a request as an object (Character = the game card), thereby enables us
    to parametrize other OBJECTS wjth different requests, queues or logs...

                                EXAMPLE
                                -------
*  The game is no longer character dependent!, we could inject any card (character Kirby/mario) into the console (Gameboy)
*  ;i.e inject (DI) of any type of character command (MarioUpCommand,KirbyUpCommand, ....) into the console which
*  means insert any card!.
